          the law;

      <p>
        The Terms of Service shall be deemed to have been entered into and
        shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
        Australia as applied to contracts made and performed entirely within
        Australia, without giving effect to any conflicts of law statutes. Any
        controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or related to the Terms
        of Service or the Service shall be settled by final and binding
        arbitration to be conducted by an arbitration tribunal in Australia,
        pursuant to the rules of the Australian Disputes Centre. Any and all
        disputes that you may have with Bonjoro shall be resolved
        individually, without resort to any form of class action.

          Our law, lawyers and court are based in Australia. In case
          there&#39;s a dispute, the place to resolve it (and law under which
          it&#39;s resolved) is Sydney, Australia.
        </p>

      <h6></h6>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">General Legal Terms</h3>
      <p>
        The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between You and Bonjoro
        and govern Your use of the Service and completely replace any prior
        agreements between You and Bonjoro in relation to the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any part of the Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable,
        that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable
        law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the
        parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and
        effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The failure of Bonjoro to exercise or enforce any right or provision
        of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any
        right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
        rights hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that if Bonjoro does not exercise or enforce any legal right
        or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Bonjoro has the
        benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a
        formal waiver of Bonjoro&#39;s rights and that those rights or
        remedies will still be available to Bonjoro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bonjoro shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its
        obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable
        control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of
        terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor
        conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may assign this contract at any time to any parent, subsidiary, or
        any affiliated company, or as part of the sale to, merger with, or
        other transfer of our company to another entity.
