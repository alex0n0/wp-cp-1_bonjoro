    <p>Bonjoro is building the world's first Customer Delight platform to help great teams build real relationships with their customers at scale.</p>
    <p>Originally developed as our own customer success hack for our last business; overnight, Bonjoro tripled our response rates vs. automated emails. (See our final version of Bonjoro here).</p>
    <p>Two years later thousands of
      businesses across the world use
      Bonjoro to spark meaningful
      conversations and powerful,
      lasting relationships with their
      customers too. And the journey
      has only just begun.</p>

          <h3 class="b-8">Act with honour</h3>
          <p class="b-5">To accept and acknowledge personal responsibility for one’s actions with honesty, fairness & integrity</p>
          <p class="small">We will always be honest, open and fair with each other and you, and we expect the same treatment back. We won’t work with anyone we don’t believe holds to this.</p>

        <div class="mb-48">
          <h3 class="b-8">Excel creatively</h3>
          <p class="b-5">To inspire and encourage originality of thought, expression and imagination.</p>
          <p class="small">We believe creativity exists in, and benefits every business role, and try to ensure each team member is mindful of their creative self. We further aim to inspire our customers, and build them the tools to realise their creativity, whatever their industry.</p>

        <div class="mb-48">
          <h3 class="b-8">Delight in what we do</h3>
          <p class="b-5">To take great pleasure in working with one another, the business and our customers.</p>
          <p class="small">We really don’t take ourselves too seriously. Your work and your team are a huge part of your life, and if they don't bring you regular enjoyment and pride, you are probably doing the wrong thing. (and you should probably join us).</p>

          <p class="small">The best thing about business is its ability as a tool to help make a positive impact on the world. We are part of the 1% movement and support non-profits today. We have a special place in our hearts for environmental causes and sponsor bears amongst other things.</p>

          <p class="small">Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were always laying bricks. The best businesses, and relationships, take time, and we build products for long term success, rather than magic wands. We make sure we build the strongest foundations to support this.</p>

        <div class="mb-48">
          <h3 class="b-8">Deliver significant value</h3>
          <p class="b-5">To make sure one’s actions deliver relative worth, merit, or importance</p>
          <p class="small">Great things are achieved by taking thousands of small, but significant steps. We believe in efficiency and smart decisions rather than time for time’s sake.</p>
