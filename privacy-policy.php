      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
      <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
        websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s
        reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
        company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
        websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its
        website stating exactly the information being collected and those
        individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
      <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
      <p>
        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
        home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after
        entering our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &#39;Privacy&#39; and can
        easily be found on the page specified above.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On our Privacy Policy Page</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">Can change your personal information:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By logging in to your account</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>
      <p>
        We don&#39;t honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant
        cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser
        mechanism is in place. We don&#39;t honor them because:
      </p>
      <p>It&#39;s required for Account Holders to use the service</p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
      <p>
        It&#39;s also important to note that we do not allow third-party
        behavioral tracking
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
        under the age of 13 years old, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy
        Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
        Commission, United States&#39; consumer protection agency, enforces
        the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
        services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
        old.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">Fair Information Practices</h3>
      <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
        law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
        the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">We will notify you via email</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Other</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">Within 1 Calendar Month</h3>
      <p>
        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
        individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
        against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
        This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
        rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
        courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
        non-compliance by data processors.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">CAN SPAM Act</h3>
      <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
        establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
        right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
        tough penalties for violations.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 b-7">We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
